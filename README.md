# Shoprite Coupon Clipper

The goal of this project is to create a Python script that will automatically clip all Shoprite coupons to a given Price Plus Card account everyweek when they are updated. It will start as a simple script before advancing to creating a Cloud Software Application that can do this for any given user.
